# Agile Software Development Project - Admin Area

## Description

This repository contains the code for my university project developed as part of the Agile Software Development unit. Our team, consisting of 6 members, collaborated to build the admin area of a website using Visual Studio, C#, ASP.NET, and a small amount of CSS for styling. As a team, we followed Agile principles and practices, including Test Driven Development (TDD).

## Project Overview

The goal of the project was to create the admin area of a website. My role in the team was as the Scrum Master, responsible for facilitating the Agile processes and ensuring smooth collaboration. I specifically took charge of creating the Orders section of the website. This included developing the following pages:

- `OrderConfirmDelete.aspx`: Page for confirming the deletion of an order.
- `OrderConfirmDelete.aspx.cs`: Code-behind file for the `OrderConfirmDelete.aspx` page.
- `OrderDataEntry.aspx`: Page for entering order data.
- `OrderDataEntry.aspx.cs`: Code-behind file for the `OrderDataEntry.aspx` page.
- `OrderList.aspx`: Page displaying the list of orders.
- `OrderList.aspx.cs`: Code-behind file for the `OrderList.aspx` page.
- `OrderViewer.aspx`: Page for viewing an individual order.
- `OrderViewer.aspx.cs`: Code-behind file for the `OrderViewer.aspx` page.
- `style.css`: CSS file used for styling the various pages in the admin area.

Additionally, the repository includes a directory called `/TestingOrder`, which contains test-related files for the order functionality:

- `tstOrder.cs`: Test file for the order class.
- `tstOrderCollection.cs`: Test file for the order collection.
